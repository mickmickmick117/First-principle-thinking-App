# First-principle-thinking-App
App leverages generative AI (OpenAI’s GPT models) as a flexible “algorithm” to provide structured, stepwise analysis of complex, open-ended problems. The app helps users to break down challenges, identify assumptions, and generate new solution pathways using first principles thinking—a reasoning process often not supported by “classic” algorithms.
